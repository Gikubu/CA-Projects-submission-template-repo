PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this project, We analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Data for each year of funding is located in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files are the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

As Data Analysts for this project, we ask business inquiries, investigate the datasets, clean and set up the datasets, dissect the last arranged dataset and tell compelling stories using the appropriate visualizations.

## Project Description



## Setup

It is recommended to have a Jupyter notebook or any other standard code editor on your local machine.
Install the required packages locally to your computer.

It is recommended that you run a python version above 3.0. You can download the required python version from here.

Use these recommended steps to set up your local machine for this project:

Create the Python's virtual environment :
This will isolate the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts.
Choose any of the line of code that will work on your local machine.

     python3 -m venv venv
     python -m venv venv
Activate the Python's virtual environment :
This will ensure that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the created isolated environment.

     - for windows : 
                  venv\Scripts\activate

     - for Linux & MacOS :
                  source venv/bin/activate
Upgrade Pip :
Pip is the installed libraries/packages manager. Upgrading Pip will give an to up-to-date version that will work correctly.

     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Install the required libraries/packages :
There are libraries and packages that are required for this project. These libraries and packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.
The text file will allow you to import these libraries and packages into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

     python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
